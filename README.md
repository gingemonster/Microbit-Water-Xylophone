# Microbit Water Xylophone

This is a simple micro:bit project using our micro python driver for the PCA9685 https://github.com/gingemonster/PCA9685-Python-Microbit to drive 10 servo motors that play music using glasses of water and beaters.

Don't forget to check our youtube channel http://youtube.com/c/micromonsters to find inspiration using the microbit to code with your children.
